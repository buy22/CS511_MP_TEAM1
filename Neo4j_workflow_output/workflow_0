0,2,0,"You are arguing to argue, I don't mind a story, I don't want it to be so long I can't play for 60 minutes to start a player, is that hard to understand? "
0,2,0,"I'm thinking about ending my life right now. Godspeed, you're not alone. "
0,3,0,"I think that's a bug, personally from a lot of campaign and a bit of custom battles night runners don't feel like a replacement for slingers.

Slingers feel far more useful for harassing units around your army and getting in that morale damage.(Some Skaven clan rats and a unit of slingers can make Kroxigores route with a good surround and focus fire, especially with a spell in the middle of them or sniping the lord.)

While Nightrunners are better at dedicated skirmishers, harass arches with them, force the enemy to draw units away and pepper them, and once they're out of ammo just use them to flank for your clan rats and break units.

I haven't really tried out the more expensive variants of the night runners, but I imagine they play the same but just a bit more annoying.

So, vs AI you can break up their army and possibly even pull half of it away with just a few nightrunners while constantly plinking at their health. Vs players they seem like an annoyance and way to distract/take away some of their micro or punish them if they're not paying attention."
